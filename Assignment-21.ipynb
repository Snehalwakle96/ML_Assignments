    "### 1. What is the estimated depth of a Decision Tree trained (unrestricted) on a one million instance training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated Depth of a Decision Tree:\n",
    "The depth of a Decision Tree trained on a large dataset like one million instances can vary, but generally, \n",
    "it could reach up to 20 to 30 levels deep. The depth depends on the complexity and the number of features in the data.\n",
    "The tree grows until all leaves are pure or until all features are used up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Is the Gini impurity of a node usually lower or higher than that of its parent? Is it always lower/greater, or is it usually lower/greater?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini Impurity Comparison:\n",
    "The Gini impurity of a child node is usually lower than that of its parent node. It is not always lower, but it is typically lower, \n",
    "because the tree splits the data in a way that minimizes impurity. However, in some cases, depending on the split, the impurity \n",
    "might not reduce as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Explain if it's a good idea to reduce max depth if a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing Max Depth to Prevent Overfitting:\n",
    "Yes, reducing the max depth of a Decision Tree is a good strategy to prevent overfitting. A deeper tree might capture noise \n",
    "and lead to overfitting. By limiting the depth, you constrain the model, making it more generalized to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explain if it's a good idea to try scaling the input features if a Decision Tree underfits the training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Input Features for Decision Trees:\n",
    "Scaling the input features does not typically affect the performance of Decision Trees, as they are not sensitive to the \n",
    "scale of the input data. If a Decision Tree is underfitting, it's better to focus on other hyperparameters like increasing \n",
    "the max depth, reducing the minimum samples required to split a node, or allowing more leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set of 10 million instances if it takes an hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set with 1 million instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Time Estimate for Larger Dataset:\n",
    "The time complexity of training a Decision Tree is O(n log n), where n is the number of instances. If it takes 1 hour for \n",
    "1 million instances, for 10 million instances, it could take approximately 10 times longer, so around 10 hours. \n",
    "However, the exact time might vary based on the implementation and system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Will setting presort=True speed up training if your training set has 100,000 instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect of presort=True on Training Speed:\n",
    "Setting presort=True can speed up training for small datasets, but for large datasets like 100,000 instances, \n",
    "it could actually slow down the process. Presorting helps with splits but incurs additional computational overhead \n",
    "that might outweigh the benefits for larger datasets.\n",
