    "# 1. Differences Between Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the correct output (label). The model learns to predict the output from the input data.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Image classification, spam detection, and house price prediction.\n",
    "- **Goal**: The goal is to predict the output for new, unseen data based on the patterns learned from the labeled training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semi-Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. The model uses the labeled data to learn and then extrapolates this learning to the unlabeled data.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Webpage classification, where only some pages are labeled; speech recognition with few labeled audio samples.\n",
    "- **Goal**: To leverage the abundance of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy when labeled data is scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to identify patterns and structures in the input data without any explicit instruction on what to look for.\n",

    "  1. **Binary Classification**: SVM is commonly used for binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous cells.\n",
    "  2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Although SVM is inherently a binary classifier, techniques like one-vs-one or one-vs-all are used to handle multi-class problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "1. **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces**: SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n",
